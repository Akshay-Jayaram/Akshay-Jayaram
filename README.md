Welcome to my GitHub page! Here you'll find a collection of my projects and skills as a passionate software developer. I'm currently on the lookout for a full-time opportunity, eager to apply my skills and passion for innovation.

## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Akshay Jayaram, a software engineer with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of California, Riverside. My expertise spans cloud computing, DevOps, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and CloudFormation, with a focus on building scalable and reliable solutions.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a coffee enthusiast, a nature lover, and a strong advocate for work-life balance.
